Contributing to LTeX_extra
I appreciate your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features
Becoming a maintainer
I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
Issue that pull request!
Any contributions you make will be under the same software license.


Report bugs using Github's issues
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

A quick summary and/or background
Steps to reproduce
Be specific!
Give sample code if you can.
What you expected would happen
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
