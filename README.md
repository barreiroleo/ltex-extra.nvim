## Installation
This plugin requires an instance of `ltex_ls` language server attached in the current buffer.

*Note: [`ltex-ls`](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls) is available by [`nvim-lsp-installer`](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer).*

### Packer
```lua
use { "barreiroleo/ltex-extra.nvim" }
```

## Configuration
The recommended way to use `ltex-extra` is calling it from `ltex-ls` `on_attach` event.
Next example use `nvim-config` typical launch server and default settings for `ltex-extra`, you can use it as template.

*Notes: You can pass to set up only the arguments that you are interested in.
At the moment, if you define stuff in `dictionary`, `disabledRules` and `hiddenFalsePositives` in your `ltex` settings, they haven't backup.*

```lua
require("lspconfig").ltex.setup {
    on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
        --- your other on_attach functions.
        require("ltex_extra").setup{
            load_langs = {"es-AR", "en-US"},
            init_check = true,
        }
    end,
    capabilities = capabilities,
    settings = {
        ltex = {
            --- your settings.
        }
    }
}
```

## To-do list
- [x] Write the docs.
- [x] Add capability for create dictionary, disabledRules and hiddenFalsePositives keys in ltex settings.
- [ ] Add path specification for files in setup.
- [ ] Add capability for read the existing files in path.
- [ ] Abort initial load if the files doesn't exist.
